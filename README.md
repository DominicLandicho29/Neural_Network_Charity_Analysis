- Unfortunately I was unable to get my model to above 75% accuracy score. However, compared to my original model, I was able to increase the accuracy to 56%.

## Summary

- The model woud benefit from adjusting different target variables.
- More experimentation can be done within the dataset such as dropping different columns and testing variables.
